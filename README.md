## Process
### Planning

This project took very little time to plan compared to previous projects due to the fact that there was no javascript logic required at all. My main focus was simply getting all of the necessary information on the page in an easy to use and aesthetically pleasing way. I did make a simple wireframe/plan just to help me get started but didn't stick to it in any way once I got going.

### Styling

### Challenges
* Responsiveness was definitely the most difficult part of this project. Although using Bulma helps in some ways, its really not enough for the app to work seamlessly on every screen size. I also found some layout differences between different browsers that I couldn't figure out the reason for.
